# EdoTeX - TeX for education

## About

EdoTeX is developed for education usage in Germany. An internationalization 
will be creted in the future. Examples and a documentation will be added soon.

This project will be embedded in a webserver for schools to render accurate pdf
worksheets and tests.    

## TeX

EdoTex is based on plainTeX and does not support LaTeX extentions. The minimal.ltx
files shound not be used to enable those features. EdoTex is designed to be
minimal and will only offer basic functions like the idea of Donald Knuth. 

## TODO

 * write a documentation
 * create example files
 * rewrite sh files
 * add linux and mac os X binaries 
 * enable luatex support
 * ...
